However, the precision of such techniques may be limited due to visual distortions in the images, such as glare and shadows. Instead, lidar data may be available (e.g., for object avoidance in automated navigation), and may serve as a high-precision data source for such determinations. Respective lidar points of a lidar point cloud may be mapped to voxels of a three-dimensional voxel space, and voxel clusters may be identified as objects. The movement of the lidar points may be classified over time, and the respective objects may be classified as moving or stationary based on the classification of the lidar points associated with the object. This classification may yield precise results, because voxels in three-dimensional voxel space present clearly differentiable statuses when evaluated over time.

The accuracy of such scanning techniques is dependent upon the calibration of the orientation of the lidar sensor, because small discrepancies between a presumed orientation and an actual orientation may result in significant differences in the detected properties of various objects. Such errors are often avoided by calibrating the lidar sensor before use for scanning, and/or registering the lidar data set, but lidar sensors in the field may still become miscalibrated and may generate inaccurate data. Presented herein are techniques for identifying, verifying, and/or correcting for lidar calibration by projecting a lidar pattern on a surface of the environment, and detecting changes in detected geometry from one or more locations. Comparing detected angles with predicted angles according to a predicted calibration enables the detection of calibration differences.

As the delay lines of said antenna-containing pixels in said array are tuned, each antenna emits light of a specific phase to form a desired far-field radiation pattern through interference of these emissions. Said array serves the function of solid state optical phased array. By incorporating a large number of antennas, high-resolution far-field patterns can be achieved by an optical phased array, supporting the radiation pattern beam forming and steering needed in solid state lidar, as well as the generation of arbitrary radiation patterns as needed in three-dimensional holography, optical memory, mode matching for optical space-division multiplexing, free space communications, and biomedical sciences. Whereas imaging from an array is conventionally transmitted through the intensity of the pixels, the optical phased array allows imaging through the control of the optical phase of pixels that receive coherent light waves from a single source.

A servo controller synchronizes the rotation rates of a pair of wedge scanners with high precision to the multi-kilohertz laser fire rate producing an infinite variety of well-controlled scan patterns. This causes the beam pattern to be laid down in precisely the same way on each scan cycle, eliminating the need to record the orientations of the wedges accurately on every laser fire, thereby reducing ancillary data storage or transmission requirements by two to three orders of magnitude and greatly simplifying data preprocessing and analysis. The described system also uses a holographic element to split the laser beam into an array that is then scanned in an arbitrary pattern. This provides more uniform signal strength to the various imaging detector channels and reduces the level of optical crosstalk between channels, resulting in a higher fidelity three-dimensional image.

Resolving these ambiguities is important to achieve desirable geolocation and image quality performance in these systems. A new method is described to iteratively resolve the ambiguities. For Doppler ambiguity applications, a first PRF value and an initial Doppler frequency search window are selected. A new PRF is determined based on the ratio of the initial search window to the first PRF. The radar data of the first pair of PRF\u0027s is used to determine two modulo Doppler estimates. The modulo Doppler estimates are used to determine a new Doppler estimate with a confidence interval smaller than the first search window. The ratio of the new Doppler search window to the first PRF, is used to determine the next PRF. This process is iterated until the new Doppler search window is less than the first PRF.

An autodyne system can use a single laser source and a single detector. The autodyne technique can mix two signal beams to produce a \"beat note\" at the frequency difference between the beams. Autodyne detection can leverage photon counting to support significantly reduced system complexity. Reduced complexity may provide solutions with significantly reduced power consumption, lighter weight, smaller volume, and lower cost. The multifunction LIDAR system can detect and identify regions of weather hazards such as lightning storms, aircraft wake vortex, clear air turbulence, and wind shear. The multifunction LIDAR system may also be configured to measure aircraft air and ground speed in multiple dimensions as well as aircraft altitude.

For determining a Doppler shift, an interferogram is generated by means of an interferometer (16), the intensity distribution of the interferogram being directly measured by means of a photodetector (17). The measured intensity distribution is compared with one or more reference patterns which had previously been determined for defined parameters and are filed in a memory device (18a). From the comparison, the Doppler shift is determined as a measurement for the wind velocity.

Further, earth moving equipment can be controlled using the same information. The laser scanning system can also be used to determine if two parts can be mated together by scanning and comparing the parts that are to be mated. The laser scanning system can further be used to determine if an object can be moved through an opening in a structure by comparing scan points of the structure with scan points from the object. The laser scanning system can additionally be used to identifying objects within the site, to build databases that have relevant information about the objects, and to guide reproducing machines.
